> A curated list of personal data stores and associated technology.

## Personal Data Stores

- [Atomic and Atomic Data Server](https://atomicserver.eu/) : a lightweight, yet powerful CMS / Graph Database
- [Data Spaces]() : 
- [Ceramic and Compose DB](https://ceramic.network/composedb):A graph database to build social networks, collaboration tools, identity and reputation systems, knowledge graphs, and more : 
- [Decentralized Web
  Nodes](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/) : A mesh-like datastore construction that enable an entity to operate multiple nodes that sync to the same state across one another, enabling the owning entity to secure, manage, and transact their data with others without reliance on location or provider-specific infrastructure, interfaces, or routing mechanisms.
- [Peergos](https://peergos.org/) : Peergos secures your files with quantum-resistant end-to-end encryption and ensures all data about your files, including who you share them with, remains private.
- [Encrypted Data
  Vaults](https://digitalbazaar.github.io/encrypted-data-vaults/) : A
  specification that describes a privacy-respecting mechanism for storing, indexing, and retrieving encrypted data at a storage provider
- [MyDex](The MyDex Personal Data Store is a secure data vault residing in the cloud and hosted by MyDex Community Interest Company. An individual’s data is encrypted at rest using the individual’s key. MyDex does not have access to any key for decryption.) : 
- [The Hub of All Things]() : 
- [Solid Pods](https://solidproject.org/) : Solid is a specification that lets
  individuals and groups store their data securely in decentralized data stores
  called Pods. Pods are like secure web servers for data. HTTP Based.
- [UBOS]( https://ubos.net/docs/architecture/) : Core to UBOS is UBOS Gears, which automates many of the otherwise complex and laborious tasks of systems administrators administering peer computing applicationsa.
- [Verida](https://www.verida.network/) :  Verida is a layer zero DePIN ecosystem that combines the performance and privacy of traditional databases with user controlled keys for complex DApps
- [WebNative Filesystem](https://github.com/wnfs-wg) : The Web Native File System (WNFS) is a distributed file system. It is versioned, logged, programmable, has strong-yet-flexible security, and is fully controlled by the end user. Service providers can validate writes without reading the contents of the file system, and minimal metadata is leaked.

## Data Formats

- [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) :  Data model for content addressable web. It allows us to treat all hash-linked data structures as subsets of a unified information space, unifying all data models that link data with hashes as instances of IPLD.
- [DID Documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) : A set of data describing the DID subject, including mechanisms, such as cryptographic public keys, that the DID subject or a DID delegate can use to authenticate itself and prove its association with the DID.
- [Verifiable Credentials Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) : Specification describing a claim,
  credential, and presentation data model

## Authorization Models

- [GNAP](https://oauth.net/gnap/) : GNAP (Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol) is an in-progress effort to develop a next-generation authorization protocol. 
- [OpenID](https://openid.net/) : OpenID Connect is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 framework of specifications (IETF RFC 6749 and 6750).

## Storage

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) : The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring content-addressed data in a decentralized file system.
